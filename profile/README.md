Note: Anu Initiative is a pilot project for this toolkit that we are preparing for the Charity Sector.

**Welcome to the Anu Initiative**, a Company Limited by Guarantee based in Dublin, Ireland.

## About Us
Anu Initiative is a **community-driven organization** where anyone can contribute to restoring the environment. 

Our **open-source platform** offers transparency on how funds are used, ensuring that every contribution supports genuine, tangible ecological impact.

This initiative is a **pilot for a groundbreaking product** designed for the charity sector. 

Our platform provides **full transparency in tracking donations and contributions**, all the way down to the associated positive ecological impact generated, connecting donors directly to the impact of their contributions.

## Our Mission
To provide for those that provide for Mother Earth.

## Our Vision
Sustain an ecosystem where the kindness of our community creates lasting, positive impacts for our planet through ecologically conscious projects.

## Our Values

## Open-Source Commitment

Anu Initiative is committed to **open-source principles**, ensuring transparency and innovation within the Web3 ecosystem. Our platform operates under the **GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991**, which allows any charity or community to adopt, modify, and extend our codebase.

### License Information:
- All core components, including our smart contracts and platform, are licensed under the [GNU General Public License Version 2](./LICENSE.md).

## Web3 Ecosystem Contributions

Our platform contributes to the **growth of the Web3 ecosystem** by bringing the traditional charitable donation system **on-chain**, enabling transparent, trustless, and verifiable ecological impact tracking using smart contracts. 

We procured a list of circa 130.000 active charities around the world, and we plan to drive mass-adoption in the charity sector by making this tool free-for-all to use. Our strategy is to help onboard as many charitable organisations in the next 3-5 years.

### Key Innovations:
- Our platform enables charities to fundraise using **novel methods**, bringing traditional fundraising **on-chain** for full transparency and connecting donors directly with verifiable proof of how their contributions are making a difference in the world.
